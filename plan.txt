authentication/accout app

his is a good start for user authentication in a Django Rest Framework application. However, depending on the
 requirements of your application, you might need to add more functionality. For example, you might want to add 
 methods for updating a user's information, changing a user's password, or resetting a forgotten password.
  You might also want to add more security features, such as throttling to prevent brute force attacks, or 
  email verification to confirm that a user owns the email address they registered with.
